# Day 1 Of Learning MySQL

Relational databases and non relational databases

I learnt that relational databases are databases which stores data in order and organized format using tables, rows and columns, which allows users to work on and to retrive data from the data base.

There are 3 major types of relational databases Command:

1. Data Definition Language:
This is used for defining and creating structure for a database. e.g CREATE, ALTER, DROP

2. Data Manipulation Language:
This is used for manipulating inputted values and also formatting values in a database. e.g SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE

3. Data Control Language:
This is used for controlling user and authorized access to a database. e.g GRANT, REVOKE.

## SQL SERVER
A server is a relational database owned/developed by microsoft in which data can be stored.

## Relational Vs Non-Relational Database
Relational databases are databases in which its data are mostly stored in a table format and also are organized and ordered. MySQL, Oracle, Ms SQL.

Non-relational databases are databases which doesnt store organized data and its best used where the data needed are to be delivered very fast like the case of a social media content. MongoDb, Redis uses this concept.
