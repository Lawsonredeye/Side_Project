# 10 Days OF MySQL

This is my personal journey of learning mysql every single day to strengthen my knowledge and broaden myself on being better than i am.

I'll be learning how to create databases, manipulate datas, using C.R.U.D as a means of building project and learning industrt standard.

This is to push me to being consistent while i learn or carry out other programmes as i traverse through this programming journey.
