# Personal Budget Calculator

This is a project for a **personal budget calculator** that would actually help ypu to manage or create a budget using the 50/30/20 rule for watching how you spend and help you manage your income.

This can be used by inputting your income/budget, then specifying what you need, want or save, then it would do the calculations for you and then return all you have left for spending and what you would have left for saving.

## How To Use

1. Install by cloning this repo
2. run by using the following command:
`python3 budget_calculator.py`
            **OR**
`./budget_calculator.py`
Thats it! You're good to go.
